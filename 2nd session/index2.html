    <p>A software application used to access information on the World Wide Web is called a Web Browser. When a user requests some information, the web browser fetches the data from a web server and then displays the webpage on the user's screen. The World Wide Web is a system of interlinked hypertext documents that can be accessed via the internet. The web is built on top of the internet, which is a global network of interconnected computers. The first web browser was created in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist. Today, there are many web browsers available, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari. Each web browser has its own strengths and weaknesses, such as speed, security, and compatibility. The web has revolutionized the way we access and share information, and has had a profound impact on modern society.

    <P>The web is used for a wide range of activities, including online shopping, social media, and education. Overall, the web has become an essential part of our daily lives, and continues to shape the way we live and work.</P>
